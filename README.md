# Web2.0_macbook_landing
This project is a React-powered storytelling website inspired by Apple’s premium design style and product showcases. The goal was to recreate a smooth, elegant, and interactive MacBook landing experience, combining clean layouts with high-quality animations and modern UI principles.

The site presents the MacBook through a storytelling flow, where each section unfolds gradually as the user scrolls — similar to how Apple reveals products on their official website. Using React’s component architecture allowed me to structure the experience into reusable, maintainable pieces, while animation tools (like GSAP/Framer Motion) helped achieve fluid transitions, scroll-based effects, and immersive visuals.

The design focuses on minimalism, typography, product focus, and responsive behavior, ensuring the experience feels premium on both desktop and mobile devices. This project represents my interest in building interactive product pages and showcases my skills in front-end development, UI/UX storytelling, and React animation workflows
